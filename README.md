### What I learned

My goal with this project was to practice a bit of everything within the full stack MERN experience, including user authentication. I've been in and out of the development world lately and this was a great refresher project to make sure I'm keeping up with the things I've learned over the years. 

### Continued learning

Testing continues to elude me. I still can't quite figure out how to get them into my workflow or my projects in general.
